# 2D non-convex function optimization
All the files needed to carry out the optimization of 22 non-convex functions (in Matlab) and visualize the results (python).

The experiment folder contains the Matlab script to run the minimization of the 22 non-convex functions for Kinetic Friction-Adaptive Descent, Linearly Dissipated Hamiltonian Dynamics and Stochastic Gradient Descent (classical_experiments.m).
The success probabilities of these methods can be obtained afterwards by running SUCCESS_PROB_PLOTS.ipynb. Moreover, more informative plots can be produced with KFAD_NONCONVEX_PLOTS.ipynb.

The figures produced by the numerical experiments carried out in the dissertation are found in the figures folder. To reproduce the data required for such plots use the (classical_experiments.m) script.
